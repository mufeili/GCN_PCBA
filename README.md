# GCN on PCBA

This is an example for multi-label molecule classification with DGL on a large dataset. We assume the dataset to be too 
large to be loaded into memory at once.

## Dependencies

1. PyTorch
2. DGL

## Dataset and Task

[PCBA](http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1) is a subset from PubChem BioAssay and consists of measured biological 
activities of small molecules generated by high-throughput screening. It contains 437929 molecules for 128 binary 
classification tasks. We use a subset of 170000 molecules.

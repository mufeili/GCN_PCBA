PCBA is a subset selected from PubChem BioAssay (PCBA) containing biological activities of small molecules generated by high-throughput screening. The selection consists of 128 assays measured over 400,000 compounds.

The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
     "mol_id" - PubChem CID of the compound
     "smiles" - SMILES representation of the molecular structure
     "PCBA-XXX" - Measured results (Active/Inactive) for bioassays:
